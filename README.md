# Multifox

[Download](https://github.com/hultmann/multifox/releases/tag/3.2.3)

<hr>

Development has stopped due to
[deprecation of XPCOM extensions](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/).

However, Mozilla has implemented a very similar feature in the testing versions of Firefox (a.k.a. Nightly). [Container Tabs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Contextual_Identity_Project/Containers) are "contextual identities." There is a manipulatable list of the containers (name, icon, and color), but they have the same effect as MultiFox, and they officially will work with Firefox (even e10s). Simply add the toolbar button and go to Firefox Preferences > Privacy > Container Tabs to configure them. Read more details on the Mozilla [blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2016/06/16/contextual-identities-on-the-web/) or [Mozilla Wiki page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Contextual_Identity_Project/Containers).
